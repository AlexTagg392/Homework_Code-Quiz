## Description:
        I have created a online coding quiz, where I was given the following hypothetical situation.
         
          AS A coding bootcamp student
          I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
          SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


## Installation:

## Contributing:
    The following are the instructions that I was given:
    
              GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
        WHEN I click the start button
        THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

         WHEN I answer a question
         THEN I am presented with another question

         WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
         THEN time is subtracted from the clock

         WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
         THEN the game is over

         WHEN the game is over
         THEN I can save my initials and score
         
     These instructions were given from the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp from the University and Trilogy.
